        a file from the Internet you may use f.e. Drive or Dropbox application.
        \n\nYou will be asked to select an application if more than one is installed. A single application will be launched automatically.
        \n\nSince <b>Android KitKat</b> you may use the preinstalled document picker application. Ensure <i>Display advanced devices</i> option is enabled in settings to use the <i>Internal storage</i>.

        \n\nWith SoftDevice 7.0.0 or newer it allows also to update SoftDevice and/or bootloader OTA. To upload more than one file (for example to upload new SoftDevice and a compatible bootloader) 
        place HEX files in a single ZIP file and name them: softdevice.hex, bootloader.hex and application.hex.
